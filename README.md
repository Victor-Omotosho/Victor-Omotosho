As a Computer Science Junior at Louisiana Tech University, my core interest areas cover the spectrum of full stack engineering, data sciences and software engineering.
My experiences range from IT, Transcribing, writing code, to working with teams, problem-solving solving and Leadership.

I am currently exploring opportunities to diversify my working experience and expand my horizon.
